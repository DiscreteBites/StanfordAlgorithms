This might be an especially attractive option for those of you who coded up an SCC algorithm in Part 2 of this specialization. Alternatively, you can use Papadimitriou's randomized local search algorithm. (The algorithm from lecture is probably too slow as stated, so you might want to make one or more simple modifications to it --- even if this means breaking the analysis given in lecture --- to ensure that it runs in a reasonable amount of time.) A third approach is via backtracking.  In lecture we mentioned this approach only in passing; see Chapter 9 of the Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani book, for example, for more details."
